B-splines, or Basis Splines, are a type of piecewise-defined polynomial curve used in various fields, particularly in computer graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), and numerical analysis. They provide a flexible and versatile way to represent and manipulate curves and surfaces. B-splines offer advantages like local curve control because unlike Bezier curves and conventional polynomial curves, the degree of a B-spline curve is independent of the number of control points.
The GUI enables user to create different types of B-spline curves based on the degree and the number of control points. The user can also change parameters like the degree of the curve, number and positions of controlpoints for the existing curve, and the changes will be automatically update the shape of the curve. This will help the user understand the various parameters and their effects on the shape of the B-spline.

Steps to be followed
1. Insert the number for the degree of the curve in the "Enter the degree of curve" input box.
2. Select any points on "Plot1" graph to represent the control points for the curve.
3. Once the number of points selected becomes greater than degree, a curve will be created.
4. User can keep on adding new control points and the shape of curve will be automatically updated.
5. User can also click and drag existing control points to new location and the shape of the curve will change accordingly.
6. User can also change the degree of the existing curve by clicking "+" or "-" button.
7. User can also directly enter the degree of the curve he wants into the inputbox and press "ENTER" button to update the curve.
8. Finally the user can click "Clear Graph" button to erase the existing curve. 

Plot 2 is used to display the Basis function values for each control point for a given degree of the curve.
